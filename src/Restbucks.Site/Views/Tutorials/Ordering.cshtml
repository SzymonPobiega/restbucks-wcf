<h2>Resource model</h2>
<p>
    First, we must decide what resources should be responsible for implementing the ordering. In this example we use

<p>
    Here are the steps required to build the samples from the source code.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Get the source code, either by cloning git repository
    <pre>git://github.com/SzymonPobiega/restbucks-wcf.git</pre>
    or by downloading the latest source code from <a href="https://github.com/SzymonPobiega/restbucks-wcf/zipball/master">here</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
    Get WCF Web APIs binaries or source code from <a href="http://wcf.codeplex.com">its website</a> at codeplex.
    </li>
    <li>
    Build WCF Web APIs.
    </li>
    <li>
    Open 'build' folder of WCF Web APIs and 'lib' folder of Restbucks.
    </li>
    <li>
    For every <em>.dll.txt</em> file in 'lib' folder, find corresponding <em>.dll</em> file in 'build' folder and copy
    it to the same location as <em>.dll.txt</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
    Build Restbucks.
    </li>
    <li>
    Run the client (<em>Restbucks.Client.Console</em> project).
    </li>
    <li>
    If you want to run the client against the local service instance, modify the root URL in the client code (Program.cs)
    and run the service (<em>Restbucks.Service</em> project) locally. 
    </li>
